The Lua script API has been more documentated, for any individual that wants to write script for debugging, analysing or patching specific applications/games.

The link to the API documentation can be found [here](https://12z1.com/docs/topics/scriptingnote.md.html), along with some small notes about scripts and debugging with GDB.

Thanks for reading!
