## Note for Windows
Windows版本要求您安装最新的* Microsoft Visual C ++ *。 如果遇到任何表明缺少DLL的错误，请尝试

从安装运行时[this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

## Note for Android

At the moment, support for Android **(especially 32-bit version)** is still *in experimental phase*, therefore, the amount of apps working normally can be different (or less)
from the PC version.

When you encounter a situation where the app you want to run works normally on PC version of emulator, but not on Android version, please contact the developers through [Discord](https://discord.gg/5Bm5SJ9),
or open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/EKA2L1/EKA2L1/issues).
